##Get started:
In order to get this project running on your own computer

you will need to install this packages on your RStudio project:

install.packages('<packageName>')

- dplyr
- ggplot2
- googleVis
- rlist
- shiny


##Get data:
If you want to continue working with the data from Berlin, Girona and Lyon you have nothing to do.

If you want a new set of data you will need to use the data-preparation.R script.

Using the listings and calendar files from this website:

Inside Airbnb
Apply data-preparation.R on the files that you downloaded from Inside Airbnb

Once you have your new dataset indicate the path of your new files to the getGzCsv.R

To finish properly, rename the cities on your UI.



Thank you.
